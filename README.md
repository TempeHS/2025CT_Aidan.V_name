# General Information
## About
<p align="justify">
   My game, "Rags to Riches," is a game made as a project for an assessment. It was supposed to fit the theme of "games for change," but it didn't fully meet that goal. My game details the story of a hipster who starts with nothing but a cheap metal detector and a dream to on day dine in a luxurious 5-star resturant by the seashore. You have to explore the beach, scanning for hidden treasures buried beneath the sand. Each find could be worthless junk or a fortune. With these treasures, you sell what you find, upgrade your gear, and then progress through the game to end up with the goal of dining in a 5-star restaurant, "Orion's Table".

## Objective
<p align="justify">
   The main objective of my game is to become wealthy enough to enter the luxurious 5-star restaurant by the seashore, showing the player's journey from rags to riches. To do this, you have to scavenge the beach with your cheap metal detector. You must search for hidden items buried at the beach, some worthless, some valuable, and sell their treasures to earn money. With each treasure, you can upgrade your gear, unlock new beach zones, and complete goals displayed at the top of the screen.

## What I Am Still Working On
I plan to have a fully interactive game experience. Players will be able to use their metal detectors to scan the beach and locate hidden treasures, then dig them up based on signal strength and accuracy. A shop system will allow players to sell their treasures, store valuable items, and purchase upgrades to improve the metal detectors. As players progress, new beach zones will be unlocked, allowing players to find rarer treasures and unlock new goals. I also plan to add goals and objectives to be displayed at the top of the screen to show the player's progress. This all aims to help the player progress to reach his goal of dining at Orion's Table.
